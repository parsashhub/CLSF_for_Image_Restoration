# CLSF for Image Restoration

This repository implements Constrained Least Squares Filtering (CLSF) for image restoration, aimed at improving the quality of degraded images. The code leverages a constrained least squares approach to minimize the effects of noise and distortion, providing an effective solution for various image processing applications.

## Features

- **Image Restoration**: Uses CLSF for noise reduction and image enhancement.
- **Modular Code**: Easy to integrate and modify for custom use cases.
- **Python Implementation**: Built with Python, leveraging popular libraries for matrix operations and image manipulation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc

## Usage

To run the image restoration:

1. Clone the repo.
2Run `python main.py` to process your images using CLSF.
